                CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require
                commercial websites and online services to post a privacy
                policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to
                require a person or company in the United States (and
                conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting
                personally identifiable information from California consumers to
                post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly
                the information being collected and those individuals with whom

                When it comes to the collection of personal information from
                children under 13, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act
                (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission,
                the nation’s consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA
                Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online

                The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of
                privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include
                have played a significant role in the development of data
                protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair
                Information Practice Principles and how they should be
                implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws
                that protect personal information.

              <p class="article__text">
                In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will

                occur: We will notify the users via in site notification •

              </p>

                We also agree to the individual redress principle, which
                requires that individuals have a right to pursue legally
                enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who
                fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that
                individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also
                that individuals have recourse to courts or a government agency
                to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data
                processors.
